# Webtasks
Webtasks is a habit tracking application, built as a practice clone of an app called Timecap. It is fully functional, with features such as user authentication, data persistence, and a stunning user interface. I built it to push my full-stack development skills to the max, and I'm really proud of it.

## What I learnt
1. **Vite:** For this project, instead of using Create-React-App for the initial setup, I decided to use Vite, a configuration package I had heard good things about. It's my preferred choice now.

2. **Using third-party libraries:** Case-in-point, the emoji selection menu. I used a library called Picmo, which Ifound after a little digging. It turned out to be really simple, and I got it working within a few minutes. However, I faced a frustrating bug regarding positioning the emoji picker, and I struggled with it for several hours until I fixed it with the useEffect hook.

3. **The regular developer workflow:** Over the course of Webtasks' development, I made almost a hundred commits, and I got into the habit of commiting my code after significant changes. It made me see the value in timely, regular code updates and pushes.

4. **Proper planning:** Webtasks is my first major project, and it really taught me a lot about how important it is to have a rough outline of what you're trying to build. For example, I set out to build a perfect, 1-to-1 clone of Timecap, yet felt the temptation to add numerous (and unnecessary) features to it. I stuck to the plan, and it allowed me complete the project in time.
