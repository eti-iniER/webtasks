## SKILLS I LEARNT FROM THIS PROJECT
1. **Using third-party libraries:** Case-in-point, the emoji selection menu. I used a library called Picmo, which Ifound after a little digging. It turned out to be really simple, and I got it working within a few minutes. However, I faced a frustrating bug regarding positioning the emoji picker, and I struggled with it for several hours until I fixed it with the useEffect hook.

2. **The regular developer workflow:** Over the course of Webtasks' development, I made almost a hundred commits, and I got into the habit of commiting my code after significant changes. It made me see the value in timely, regular code updates and pushes.
